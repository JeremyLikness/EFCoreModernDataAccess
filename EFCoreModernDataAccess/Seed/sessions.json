    "Description": "Optimizing Virtual Machine storage is one of the most critical areas to master when considering a migration to Azure SQL Virtual Machine. Azure virtual machines have input/output operations per second (IOPS) and throughput performance limits based on the virtual machine type and size. The limits will vary widely depending on the series and the capabilities the virtual machines offer. Additionally, OS disks and data disks can be attached to virtual machines where these disks will have their own IOPS and throughput limits. Workloads can be limited at either the virtual machine or the disk level. In this session we demystify virtual machine storage and how VM sizing will impact storage performance limits. We will cover what you should consider when choosing Azure disks and storage pool configurations. Finally we will review how to monitor IOPs and throughput limits of your virtual machine, the underlying disks, and the caching capabilities of the ephemeral disks and the storage cache. Get ready, this is one of the most important sessions to get the best performance out of your Azure virtual machine deployment!",

This can be due to vendor requirements, familiarity with virtualization, ease of migration and other scenarios. When selecting a virtual machine to host your SQL Server workload in Azure, you need to choose a virtual machine size that provides optimal performance and fits your organization\uFFFDs budget. In this session, we will cover topics such as the different virtual machine types that are most appropriate for SQL Server workloads, optimal memory-to-core ratios for various workload types, and features unique to Azure such as write acceleration that can help boost your performance without breaking the bank.\n\nWe will also cover the Azure Virtual Machine naming conventions and how you can quickly identify a given machines capabilities from the virtual machine series name. We will close out the discussion with a review of virtual machine disks and storage limits that will be a precursor to the next deep dive on Azure SQL VM storage.\u0022",
